# Hottest tools/skills/technology in the Tech sector
Dynamically scrape a job search website (Indeed): 
- Specify the keyword(s) to search
- Specify the location of the jobs
- Set restrictions on how fresh the job posting is (e.g.: posted in the last 24 hrs)
- scrape each job posting, save the results into a SQLite database

Schedule the code to run daily, using Airflow.

Use Streamlit/Tableau-Public to analyze:
- Top 10 skills/tools of the month, for each sub-domain (such as data, software engineering, etc)
- The trend of technologies over time
- The health of the tech sector market in various sub-domains

Future improvements:
- Add other job search websites, such as LinkedIn
- Implement a job posting de-duping algorithm across the sites
